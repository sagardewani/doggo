## üßë‚Äçüíª Routing & Authentication Flow

- **Public Routes:**
  - `/` (HomePage)
  - `/add-dog` (Dog Profile Registration)
  - `/dog-owner-login` (Dog Owner Login)
  - `/vendor/:id` (Vendor Profile)
  - `/vendor-panel` (Vendor Panel)
- **After Authentication (Dog Owner Only):**
  - `/feed` (DogFeed)
  - `/dogs/:dogId/add-highlight` (AddDogHighlight)
  - `/bark-ai` (BarkAI)

All after-authentication UI pages are grouped in an `AuthenticatedRoutes` wrapper for clarity and maintainability. Unauthenticated users attempting to access these routes are redirected to the home page.
